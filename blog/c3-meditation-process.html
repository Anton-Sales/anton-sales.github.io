                        It affected me in a positive way because it gave me the ability of creativity. Without looking at the end product and building
                        within the framework improved the way I researched and gave me a better understanding of my project.
                        They are still parts of the website that I’m still trying to wrap my head around, but will soon be
                        understood overtime.

                            I haven’t really thought much about meditation other than another form of exercise. I see it as another practice to improve
                            one’s mind and well-being. After trying it several times since reading chapter 1, I’ve noticed
                            I gained improvement on patience. There was also a boost of attention span but did not last for
                            long. Overtime, I hope to gain the full benefits of meditation.

                                I found that meditation helped me to ‘let go’. Letting go of everything in the past, present and future and just exist for
                                a few minutes. To be happy in your own presence and gain fulfilment out of it. A feeling
                                you could only describe when experienced firsthand.

                                    Mindfulness meditation stood out to me the most as I think improvement in that area would be beneficial. To bring complete
                                    attention to the present experience on a moment to moment basis is something I found
                                    quite interesting.
