    <div class="wrapper">

            <div class="content-container">
                <div class="left">
                    <h5>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h5>
                </div>

                    <p>
                        The relationship with mindfulness and self awareness is that they complement each other. Mindfulness is the act of non-judgemental
                        awareness of the things around us and our thoughts and feelings, it can also be interpreted as acceptance
                        in ones’ mind. Self awareness in the other hand is the conscious knowledge of our own thoughts and
                        emotions. They correlate by having the conscious thought of ones’ environment, body and lifestyle
                        with the use of mindfulness and self awareness to be able to recognize that awareness.

                <div class="left">
                    <h5>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your
                        experience of it? How did you feel?</h5>
                </div>

                        I tried journaling because it is a practice that I’ve already been doing. My experience with journaling was quite pleasant,
                        I experience a state of clarity once I was able to put my thoughts on paper. Writing anything that
                        comes to mind helps me clear my thoughts and express how I feel. I was also able to catch my self
                        by saying ‘I feel’ instead of ‘I am’. This is a great practice because I am not controlled by emotions,
                        but only feel them within me and they do not control my overall actions.

        <div class="row">

                <div class="left">
                    <h5>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h5>
                </div>
                <div class="right">
                    <p>
                        Emotions do not define us, it’s simply a phenomenon in our mind and body that comes and go. As explained in the previous
                        question, “I am not controlled by emotions, but only feel them within me and they do not control
                        my overall actions.” An emotion is a cloud that just comes and go based on the situation. It is temporary,
                        and it does not stay with us.
