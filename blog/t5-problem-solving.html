                        The problem I got blocked on was a JavaScript code for updating count whenever a dot is turned blue, green and invisible.
                        I mainly used google to find codes that are similar and understand it from a different perspective.

                        I felt frustrated that I could not solve this code after trying for an hour, but also felt relieved once I solved the problem.

                        I learned to deal with my emotions better by telling my self how I feel when solving a problem. For instance “I feel frustrated
                        trying to write this code”, this acknowledges my emotions and calms them down.

                        my problem and using different methods to solve them. Soon, I will be asking my peers for help because
                        sometimes it is also better to get other people perspective of your problem. Overall, I am confident
